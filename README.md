# 🚀 DOCKER-BASICS

In this I have printed "Hello".

First, we create the file named `app.py`.

## 🚀 Deployment
To deploy the basic website, we use the following commands:

### ✅ Check if Docker and Python are Installed
For Docker:
```bash
docker --version
```
For Python:
```bash
python --version
```
🛠 Build and Run the Docker Image
1️⃣ Build the App

docker build -t app.py .
2️⃣ Verify the Docker Image
docker images


### **3️⃣ Commit and Push to GitHub**
- After adding the content, scroll down and **commit the changes**.
- If you’re working locally, use:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README for Docker Basics"
git push origin main
